# Simple Calculator

This project demonstrates a calculator implemented using multiple interfaces to showcase clean logic design, UI development, and project evolution.

## 🔹 Project Overview

The calculator is implemented in two different ways:

1. **Python CLI Calculator**
2. **Web-based Calculator (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)**

The core idea remains the same, while the user interaction changes based on the interface.
